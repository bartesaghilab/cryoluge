# CryoLuge

A library for high-performance analysis of data from Cryo-EM and Cryo-ET,
implemented in the [Mojo](https://www.modular.com/mojo) programming language.

The software is developed and maintained by the [Bartesaghi Lab](https://cryoem.cs.duke.edu)
at [Duke University](https://www.duke.edu).


# Getting Started

This library is still very much under early development and is not ready for use in downstream projects.

The developers do not recommend trying to use this library just yet.
